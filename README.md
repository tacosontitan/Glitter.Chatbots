## 🪄 Working with Glitter

### 🎉 Create a Chatbot

It's never been easier to get a custom made chatbot up and running. Simply add a few lines of code to your `Program.cs` file to get started:

```csharp
using Glitter;
using Glitter.Commands.OpenSource;
using Glitter.Discord;

using IHost host = Host.CreateDefaultBuilder(args)
    .ConfigureServices(services => services
        .AddGlitter()
        .AddOpenSourceCommands()
        .AddDiscord("<AUTH_TOKEN>")
).Build();
await host.RunAsync();
```

With that, you've got a working chatbot that can communicate with Discord; and all that's left is to add some custom commands!

## 💪 Powered by Open Source

The following open source projects help to power both Glitter and Freya; be sure to give them a star! ⭐

- [TwitchLib](https://github.com/TwitchLib/TwitchLib)

### 🎊 Open Source Commands

There are endless possibilities for chatbot commands! Glitter encourages the open-source community to create a vast global baseline of commands for public consumption. Here's our current baseline list of commands included with all Glitter powered bots:

- `help`: Queries for a list of commands.
- `version`: Queries for the current version of the bot.
- `uptime`: Queries the time the bot has been up and running.

Of course, these are just the commands that are automatically registered with your bot through `AddOpenSourceCommands`. You can manually register any open-source command just like you would a custom made one:

```csharp
services.AddGlitter(config => config.AddCommand<MySampleCommand>());
```
